Developed an embedded application for a simple calculator that performs single operations between two integers using a keypad, LCD and ATmega 32 microcontroller. This current version has some limitations, the follwoing points will be worked on in the upcoming period to make the calculator more efficent:

- performing operations between float numbers
- division with a reminder will display a float number
- performing more than one arithmatic operation
